# Web Prototype (Archived)

This directory contains the archived React/Vite/TypeScript web prototype of ReAmp.

This was an early prototype to explore the UI/UX concepts. The current implementation is a native C++ application as described in the main README.

## Contents

- React/TypeScript source code
- Vite build configuration
- Web-based audio player components

## Note

This prototype is kept for reference. The main project is now built with C++ for native performance.
